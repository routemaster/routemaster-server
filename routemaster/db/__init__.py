"""Database models and helper functions for the RouteMaster server.

Before using this module, one of the initialize_* methods needs to be
called. (Only the first initialize_* method called will have an effect,
so you can safely call them multiple times if you want to.)

After initializing, create an instance of Session to access the
database.
